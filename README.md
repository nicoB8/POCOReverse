# POCOReverse
Empty project with the basic structure for DataBase first using a free library called "POCO Reverse"

These basic project will let you play a little bit with an EntityFramework reverse-engineering database project.
Follow these steps to try it out:
*Run the POCOTest query located in the main folder of the repository.
*Modify the Database1.tt file located on: POCOReverse/POCOReverse/Database1.tt => For the basic functionality you only need to modify the value "Settings.ConnectionStringName" and set your connection string name to let POCO Reverse connect to the database
*Save the Database1.tt file. After that, you are going to see the classes created in the file Database1.cs and in the same file, the DBContext.
*For future modifications of the database, you have to right-click on the Database1.tt file and select the option: "Run Custom Tool"
      
Just let me know if you have any doubts and, of course any commit is going to be taking in consideration!
